Biyeta Algorithm
================

Configure attribute weights in `attributes.php`. Use `weight1` (orange) and `weight2` (purple) to compare weight choices.

Configure score calculation in `functions.php` (`calcScore2()`). Dark color corresponds to binary match, while the light color corresponds to scores with discrimination within ranges.
